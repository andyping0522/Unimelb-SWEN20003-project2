# Unimelb-SWEN20003-project2
Java project for simulation

Project 2 for SWEN20003, Object-oriented software development, Semester 2, 2020, The University Of Melbourne.

There are three arguments for the program to accept, the first argument is the number of ticks per frame,
the second is the maximum number of ticks the program will wait until termination, the third is the path
to the file located at res/worlds that generates the "world".

e.g. "100 1000 res/orlds/product.csv"
